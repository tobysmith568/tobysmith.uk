# Hey, I'm Toby!

I'm a London-based software developer who likes to focus on web-based technologies.

My programming languages of choice are C# and Typescript with Angular or React; however I'm always keen to pick up new languages and frameworks.

This website is a place for me to write about cool things I find or create.
