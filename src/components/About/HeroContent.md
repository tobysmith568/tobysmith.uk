# Hey, I'm Toby!

I'm a London-based software developer who enjoys focusing on web-based technologies.

Most of the time, I work with TypeScript and C# (with a hint of Rust) on projects like websites, APIs, apps, and command line tools.

This website is a place for me to share cool things I find or create.
