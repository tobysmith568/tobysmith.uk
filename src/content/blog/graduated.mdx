After four years at The University of Plymouth, I have graduated with First-Class Honours!

I just want to take this small opportunity to say a huge thank you to everyone who has helped me throughout my studies.

While I no longer hold an interest in developing video games I'm very grateful for all the support I received from all of the staff on the Computing and Video Game Development team as well as those across all of the Computer Science department.

Looking forward, I'm so excited for my future career - especially in the web space.

Thanks again to all those who contributed to my learning over the last four years!
