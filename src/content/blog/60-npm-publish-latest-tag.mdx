In my last post, I detailed my typical CD pipeline for deploying npm packages.
At the end of the article, I outlined a caveat to bear in mind when using it:
the newly published version will always have the `latest` tag.
This is an issue because whenever someone installs a package without specifying a tag or version,
the npm CLI will default to the `latest` tag.

## The issue in depth

This:

```bash
npm install awesome-package
```

Is shorthand for

```bash
npm install awesome-package@latest
```

If you publish version v1.0.0 and then v2.0.0, the `latest` tag will initially be attached to the v1.0.0
release but will later be reassigned to the v2.0.0 release. So far, this is desired behaviour.

If/When a critical bug gets discovered in your v1.0.0 release, you might want to patch it with a v1.0.1 release,
especially if many users are still on v1 and the migration to v2 is tricky.
When your CD pipeline, as outlined in my previous post, runs, it will assign the `latest` tag to that v1.0.1 patch release;
now, anyone who runs `npm install awesome-package` will get v1.0.1, rather than v2.0.0.

> Note that the same can be said for releases that are done manually via the CLI or by any other CD process which
> doesn't factor in npm registry tags.

## The manual fix

The solution to this issue is to assign a tag to your new releases as you release them;
if the `npm publish` command has a tag supplied to it with the `--tag` flag,
then it won't automatically apply the `latest` tag.

So what do you use for tags?
Well, npm suggest you [don't use version numbers as tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/adding-dist-tags-to-packages#:~:text=We%20recommend%20avoiding%20dist%2Dtags%20that%20start%20with%20a%20number%20or%20the%20letter%20%22v%22.)
because they share the same domain as each other already when users install packages:

```bash
npm install awesome-package@my-tag
npm install awesome-package@v1.0.0
```

My solution is to explicitly provide the `latest` tag for new releases to your current major version and
apply a `latest-X` tag to patches of previous major versions, where 'X' is that major version number.

For example, if you have a v2.0.0 already released and:

- you're publishing v2.0.1: then you give it the tag `latest`
- you're publishing v1.0.1: then you give it the tag `latest-1`

Assuming you're following the SemVer specification,
this approach has the added benefit that a consumer of your package can run `npm awesome-package@latest-X`
with their current major version number and be confident that they'll get the latest and greatest version
of your package without any breaking changes in it.

## The Automatic GitHub Action fix

For those of us who deploy our npm packages via CD pipelines, we're going to need a programmatic approach to apply this solution for us.
I've written an npm package called
[`npm-publish-latest-tag`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-publish-latest-tag)
that can be used to generate these tags when given the path to a package.json file.

Internally, this package:

1. Retrieves your version from your package.json file
2. Retrieves your latest version from the supplied npm registry
3. Compares the two to either return `latest` or `latest-X`

This package is available on npmjs.com and you're welcome to use it, however,
if you also use GitHub Actions then I've also wrapped this npm package in a
[GitHub Action step](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/npm-publish-latest-tag) which I suggest you use instead.

You can amend an existing GitHub Action file by running the Action step linked to above and then passing the
outputted value into your `npm publish` command.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  # [ ... ]
  - uses: tobysmith568/npm-publish-latest-tag@v1
    id: latest_tag
    with:
      package-json: ./package.json
  # [ ... ]
  - run: npm publish --tag ${{ steps.latest_tag.outputs.latest-tag }}
    env:
      NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.npm_token }}
```

And there you go!

Hopefully, we're now all one step closer to that perfect npm CD pipeline.

## Extra benefits

An extra benefit of using my npm package or GitHub Action step is that it handles pre-release sections of versions too.
No matter if it's your current major version or not, if you publish a version that has a pre-release section then you'll
get a tag that looks like `latest-X-Y` where 'X' is the major version and 'Y' is the pre-release type (alpha, beta, etc).
Furthermore, build metadata will be ignored.

For example, if you have a v2.0.0 already released:

- Publishing v2.0.1-beta results in `latest-2-beta`
- Publishing v3.0.0-alpha results in `latest-3-alpha`
- Publishing v2.0.0+123 results in `latest`
- Publishing v2.0.1-beta+123 results in `latest-2-beta`

Users can now install `@latest` to get your latest stable major version release but can also optionally get
the latest version of your `3.X.X-beta` if they wish to without needing to know the exact version.
