Through no fault of Angular, you can't set the CSS of pseudo-elements or pseudo-classes in-line in HTML.
This means that the styling of pseudo selectors in Angular components needs to come from the CSS files, and can't be dynamically set from the component's TypeScript.

### So how can you dynamically set CSS properties for pseudo-classes like on hover?

Lets say that your component looks little like this:

```typescript
interface Icon {
  icon: string;
  url: string;
  onHoverColour: string;
}

@Component({
  ...
})
export class IconsComponent {
  public icons: Icon[] = [
    { icon: "linkedin.svg", onHoverColour: "#0a66c2", url: "https://..." },
    { icon: "youtube.svg", onHoverColour: "#ff0000", url: "https://..." },
    { icon: "github.svg", onHoverColour: "#24292e", url: "https://..." },
  ]
}
```

You have some social links that you want to display.
Each icon is black by default but you want them to change colour on-hover to be the colour of that service - blue for LinkedIn and red for YouTube etc.

In your template you `*ngFor` over each of the icons that you want to display but it's about this point that you realise that you can't set the on-hover colour in-line.

```html
<a
  *ngFor="let icon of icons"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferer"
  href="{{ icon.url }}"

  <!-- You can't do this -->
  [style:hover.color]="icon.hoverColour">

  <svg href="{{ icon.icon }}"></svg>
</a>
```

### So what can you do?

Rather than trying to set the hover colour, set the regular colour and then override it in the styles file using the `:not()` pseudo-class:

```html
<a
  \*ngFor="let icon of icons"
  target="\_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferer"
  href="{{ icon.url }}"

  <!-- Set the regular colour -->
  [style.color]="icon.hoverColour">

  <svg href="{{ icon.icon }}"></svg>
</a>
```

```css
a:not(:hover) {
  color: "black";
}
```

And there you go! You now have some dynamically created html tags which all change to different colours on-hover without needing to use in-line pseudo-selectors.
