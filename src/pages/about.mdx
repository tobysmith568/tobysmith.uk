## About Me

### Experience

Day-to-day I'm a Software Developer for Trayport Ltd at their main London office.
I spend my time working on full-stack React apps using technologies like Redux, Entity Framework, and NSwag.

In the past I've been able to work with slightly different technology stacks including tools like Java, MyBatis, Apache Camel, and Angular.
I still sometimes use Angular for personal projects where I think it's appropriate.

My education has roots in video game development which means I also have experiences creating projects using
both the Unity Game Engine, and OpenGL; though this is no longer where my current interests lie.

### My Code

I keep all my code over on my GitHub profile, <a href="https://github.com/tobysmith568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tobysmith568</a>.
My projects are usually public, so feel free to look around.

Projects created as a part of my university degree have been moved over to a separate archive account
which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/tobysmith568-university" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tobysmith568-university</a>.

Projects where I collaborate with others are usually kept in their own GitHub organizations which can also be
found on my Profile.
