## About Me

### Experience

Day-to-day, I'm a Senior Software Developer for <a href="https://trayport.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trayport Ltd.</a>
in their London office.
I spend my time working on React frontends and C# backends across various facets of their estate.

In the past, I've worked with technologies such as Java Spring and Angular, creating web-based mobile apps in the e-commerce sector.

My education has roots in video game development, which means I also have experience creating projects using both the Unity Game Engine and OpenGL.

### My Code

I keep all my code on my GitHub profile, <a href="https://github.com/tobysmith568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tobysmith568</a>.
My projects are usually public, so feel free to look around.

Projects created as part of my university degree have been moved over to a separate archive account,
which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/tobysmith568-university" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tobysmith568-university</a>.

Projects where I collaborate with others are usually kept in their own GitHub organizations,
which can also be found on my profile.
