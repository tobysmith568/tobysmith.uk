## About Me

### Experience

By day I'm a Senior Software Developer for <Anchor href="https://trayport.com" text="Trayport Ltd." /> in their London office. I spend my time working on React frontends and C# backends arocss various parts of the organization.

In the past, I've worked with technologies such as Java Spring and Angular, creating web-based mobile apps in the commerce sector.

My education has roots in video game development, which means I also have experience creating projects using both the Unity Game Engine and OpenGL.

### My Code

I keep all my peronal code on my GitHub profile, <Anchor href="https://github.com/tobysmith568" text="tobysmith568"/>. My projects are usually public, so feel free to look around.

Projects created as part of my university degree have been moved over to a separate archive account, which can be found at <Anchor href="https://github.com/tobysmith568-university" text="tobysmith568-university"/>.

Projects where I collaborate with others are usually kept in their own GitHub organizations, which can also be found on my profile.
